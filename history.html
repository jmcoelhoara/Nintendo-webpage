            initially as a playing card business specializing in Hanafuda cards. Under his leadership, Nintendo built a reputation for quality craftsmanship, 
            laying the foundation for future growth.<br><br> After retiring in 1929, Fusajiro passed the company to his son-in-law, Sekiryo Yamauchi, 
            who expanded Nintendo’s production and formalized its business structure during his tenure. Sekiryo faced various challenges, including economic downturns, 
            and ultimately chose his grandson, Hiroshi Yamauchi, as his successor.</p></th>

                Under Hiroshi’s leadership, Nintendo diversified into various ventures before focusing on electronic entertainment, which led to the creation of iconic franchises like Super Mario,
                 The Legend of Zelda, and Donkey Kong.<br> <br>He oversaw Nintendo’s global expansion, transforming it into a major player in the video game industry. 
                 After over five decades at the helm, Hiroshi retired in 2002, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most influential figures in gaming history.</p></th>

                the Nintendo DS and Wii, which were hugely successful due to their innovative gameplay.<br><br> However, Nintendo also faced challenges during his tenure,
                 particularly with the commercial struggles of the Wii U. Iwata was known for his approachable leadership style and dedication to creating fun, innovative gaming experiences.
